## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

My learning was focused on using API's to bring data to my webpage and using javascript in a dynamic way for values to come from the database.

## Optimizations

I still need to clean up the UI/UX and add a hover state. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned about DOM manipulation and using APIs.
