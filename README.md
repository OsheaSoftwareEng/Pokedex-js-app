# Official Pokedex Application
A Pokedex device application aspired from the Pokemon TV series. This app has a collection of Pokemon that are being called at a press of a button from an API database of Pokemon. Once the Pokemon are called, the Pokemon image, Name and Height are displayed as a popup modal.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap

My learning was focused on using API's to bring data to my webpage and using javascript in a dynamic way for values to come from the database.

## Optimizations

I still need to clean up the UI/UX and add a hover state and animations. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned about DOM manipulation and using APIs.
